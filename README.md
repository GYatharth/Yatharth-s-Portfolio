## Challenges Faced:

Capturing the show's bold, mysterious vibe required careful selection of colors, typography, and subtle animations. Balancing aesthetics with usability was key.

-Responsive and Accessible Design:
Ensuring the site looked great and was fully functional on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, while maintaining accessibility standards.
